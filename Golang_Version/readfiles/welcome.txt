Dungeons and Dragons is a Tabletop Roleplaying Game that immerses the player in a world of medieval weaponry and magic.
*You are a Player, an individual that inhabits this world that will come to shape it one way or another, either in a small scale or a gigantic one, through your actions or inactions.
*You will shape your character and will embark on a journey laid to you by your Dungeon Master.
*Your choices will affect the world around you and the world will affect your choices.
*But first things first, you need to create your character, and this is were this DnD Character Creator comes in.
*You will be given various prompts to create your character, and then You will be given your character sheet in the form of a txt file.
*It is understandable that a txt file is not the best of formats for this, but having a program make your character is pretty nifty, no?
